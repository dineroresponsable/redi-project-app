This was a prototype for a challenge in a special event, it was build with MEAN technology
To install just clone this repo and type `npm install` once that you've already installed, it's necessary run mongo
so if you have already installed go to your `data\db` folder and run `mongod`, when your mongo has already running
go to server folder and `node index` to start the server and check `localhost:3000/users` to test it.

Whit your service running, go to the client folder and follow the client's readMe steps.
